Placetime Internship Problem

We are getting multiple Location (Lat/Long) details from a group of travelers who are travelling together. However, some devices send wrong location details (totally off from other traveler gps detail). How to remove such odd locations out (cleansing data/removing odd man out) and select only one best location as the final output for the entire group of travelers?
